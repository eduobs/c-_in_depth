                    <h1>Part 1 - C# in context</h1>
                    <p>
                        When I was studying computer science at university, a fellow student corrected the lecturer
                        about a detail he’d written on the blackboard. The lecturer looked mildly exasperated and
                        answered, “Yes, I know. I was simplifying. I’m obscuring the truth here to demonstrate a bigger
                        truth.” Although I hope I’m not obscuring much in part 1, it’s definitely about the bigger
                        truth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of this book looks at C# close up, occasionally putting it under a microscope to see the
                        finest details. Before we start doing that, chapter 1 pulls back the lens to see the broader
                        sweep of the history of C# and how C# fits into the wider context of computing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You’ll see some code as an appetizer before I serve the main course of the rest of the book, but
                        the details don’t matter at this stage. This part is more about the ideas and themes of C#’s
                        development to get you in the best frame of mind to appreciate how those ideas are
                        implemented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s go!
                    </p>
                    <br /><br />

                    <h2><strong>1</strong> Survival of the sharpest</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>This chapter covers</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How C#’s rapid evolution has made developers more productive</li>
                        <li>Selecting minor versions of C# to use the latest features</li>
                        <li>Being able to run C# in more environments</li>
                        <li>Benefitting from an open and engaged community</li>
                        <li>The book’s focus on old and new C# versions</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Choosing the most interesting aspects of C# to introduce here was difficult. Some are fascinating
                        but are rarely used. Others are incredibly important but are now commonplace to C# developers.
                        Features such as async/wait are great in many ways but are hard to describe briefly. Without
                        further ado, let’s look at how far C# has come over time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.1 An evolving language</h3>
                    <p>
                        In previous editions of this book, I provided a single example that showed the evolution of the
                        language over the versions covered by that edition. That’s no longer feasible in a way that
                        would be interesting to read. Although a large application may use almost all of the new
                        features, any single piece of code that’s suitable for the printed page would use only a subset
                        of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead, in this section I choose what I consider to be the most important themes of C#
                        evolution and give brief examples of improvements. This is far from an exhaustive list of
                        features. It’s also not intended to teach you the features; instead, it’s a reminder of how far
                        features you already know about have improved the language and a tease for features you may not
                        have seen yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you think some of these features imitate other languages you’re familiar with, you’re almost
                        certainly right. The C# team does not hesitate to take great ideas from other languages and
                        reshape them to feel at home within C#. This is a great thing! F# is particularly worth
                        mentioning as a source of inspiration for many C# features.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic; color: grey;">
                        NOTE It’s possible that F#’s greatest impact isn’t what it enables for F# developers but its
                        influence on C#. This isn’t to underplay the value of F# as a language in its own right or to
                        suggest that it shouldn’t be used directly. But currently, the C# community is significantly
                        larger than the F# community, and the C# community owes a debt of gratitude to F# for inspiring
                        the C# team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let’s start with one of the most important aspects of C#: its type system.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.1.1 A helpful type system at large and small scales</h3>
                    <p>
                        C# has been a statically typed language from the start: your code specifies the types of
                        variables, parameters, values returned from methods, and so on. The more precisely you can
                        specify the shape of the data your code accepts and returns, the more the compiler can help you
                        avoid mistakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That’s particularly true as the application you’re building grows. If you can see all the code
                        for your whole program on one screen (or at least hold it all in your head at one time), a
                        statically typed language doesn’t have much benefit. As the scale increases, it becomes
                        increasingly important that your code concisely and effectively communicates what it does. You
                        can do that through documentation, but static typinglets you communicate in a machine-readable
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As C# has evolved, its type system has allowed more fine-grained descriptions. The most obvious
                        example of this is generics. In C# 1, you might have had code like this:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/711143c2b13501534436720d0432639d.js"></script>

                    <p>What type is each item in the Books sequence? The type system doesn’t tell you. With generics in
                        C# 2, you can communicate more effectively:</p>

                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/cd284a83d3859b02c32cbcd7ed8e3655.js"></script>

                    <p>
                        C# 2 also brought <code><i>nullable value types</i></code>, thereby allowing the absence of
                        information to be expressed effectively without resorting to magic values such as –1 for a
                        collection index or <code><i>DateTime.MinValue</i></code> for a date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        C# 7 gave us the ability to tell the compiler that a user-defined struct should be immutable
                        using <i>readonly struct</i> declarations. The primary goal for this feature may have been to
                        improve the efficiency of the code generated by the compiler, but it has additional benefits for
                        communicating intent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plans for C# 8 include <i>nullable reference types</i>, which will allow even more
                        communication. Up to this point, nothing in the language lets you express whether a reference
                        (either as a return value, a parameter, or just a local variable) might be null. This leads to
                        error-prone code if you’re not careful and boilerplate validation code if you are careful,
                        neither of which is ideal. C# 8 will expect that anything not explicitly nullable is intended
                        not to be nullable. For example, consider a method declaration like this:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/706c2b19f9dbfbd616c4fe2f4c2110cb.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        The parameter types indicate that the argument corresponding to x shouldn’t be null
                        but that the argument corresponding to y may be null. The return type indicates that
                        the method won’t return null.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other changes to the type system in C# are aimed at a smaller scale and focus on
                        how one method might be implemented rather than how different components in a
                        large system relate to each other. C# 3 introduced <i>anonymous types and implicitly typed
                            local variables</i> (var). These help address the downside of some statically typed
                        languages:
                        verbosity. If you need a particular data shape within a single method but
                        nowhere else, creating a whole extra type just for the sake of that method is overkill.
                        Anonymous types allow that data shape to be expressed concisely without losing the
                        benefits of static typing:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/dd58308825e41cac8aeea0fd83e0b725.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        Anonymous types are primarily used within LINQ queries, but the principle of creating a type
                        just for a single method doesn’t depend on LINQ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, it seems redundant to explicitly specify the type of a variable that is initialized in
                        the same statement by calling the constructor of that type. I know which of
                        the following declarations I find cleaner:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/b2e88dcdeb245e5fc6b4c796b9ba78ab.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        Although implicit typing is necessary when working with anonymous types, I’ve found it increasingly useful when working with regular types, too.
                        It’s important to distinguish between <i>implicit</i> typing and <i>dynamic</i> typing. The preceding <b>map2</b> variable is still statically typed, but you didn’t have to write the type explicitly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anonymous types help only within a single block of code; for example, you can’t
                        use them as method parameters or return types. <b>C# 7</b> introduced <i>tuples</i>: value types
                        that effectively act to collect variables together. The framework support for these
                        tuples is relatively simple, but additional language support allows the elements of
                        tuples to be named. For example, instead of the preceding anonymous type, you
                        could use the following:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/0fe233c8f80b10d76924efb2e2b2def7.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        Tuples can replace anonymous types in some cases but certainly not all. One of their
                        benefits is that they <i>can</i> be used as method parameters and return types. At the
                        moment, I advise that these be kept within the internal API of a program rather than
                        exposed publicly, because tuples represent a simple composition of values rather than
                        encapsulating them. That’s why I still regard them as contributing to simpler code at
                        the implementation level rather than improving overall program design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I should mention a feature that <i>might</i> come in <b>C# 8</b>: <i>record types</i>. 
                        I think of these as named anonymous types to some extent, at least in their simplest form. 
                        They’d provide the benefits of anonymous types in terms of removing boilerplate code but then
                        allow those types to gain extra behavior just as regular classes do. Watch this space!
                    </p>

                    <h3>1.1.2 Ever more concise code</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the recurring themes within new features of C# has been the ability to let you
                        express your ideas in ways that are increasingly concise. The type system is part of this,
                        as you’ve seen with anonymous types, but many other features also contribute to this.
                        There are lots of words you might hear for this, especially in terms of what can be
                        removed with the new features in place. C#’s features allow you to reduce <i>ceremony</i>,
                        remove <i>boilerplate</i> code, and avoid <i>cruft</i>. These are just different ways of talking about
                        the same effect. It’s not that any of the now-redundant code was wrong; it was just distracting
                        and unnecessary. Let’s look at a few ways that C# has evolved in this respect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CONSTRUCTION AND INITIALIZATION
                        <br />
                        First, we’ll consider how you create and initialize objects. Delegates have probably
                        evolved the most and in multiple stages. In C# 1, you had to write a separate method
                        for the delegate to refer to and then create the delegate itself in a long-winded way.
                        For example, here’s what you’d write to subscribe a new event handler to a button’s
                        <b>Click</b> event in C# 1:
                    </p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/eduobs/3633a277cc81ea8ae40e1f849cc72047.js"></script>
                    <p>
                        C# 2 introduced <i>method group conversions</i> and <i>anonymous methods</i>. 
                        If you wanted to keep the <b>HandleButtonClick</b> method, method group conversions would allow you to
                        change the preceding code to the following:
                    </p>
